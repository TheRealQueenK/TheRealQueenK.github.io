As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        </span>
    <span class="group2" ">
I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
</span>
    <span class="group3">
It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</span>
    <span class="group1">
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
</span>
    <span class="group4">
"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù
</span>
    <span class="group1">
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
        </span>
    <span class="group4">
        "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."
        </span>
        <span class="group1">
        And I felt him to be more fragile still.
             </span>
            <span class="group2">
            I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .
